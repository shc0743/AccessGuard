                <p>This page is a security check to confirm you're a real person, not an automated program. Please wait a moment while we complete the verification.</p>
                <p>Here's why we do this:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We use a light security process that's quick for individuals but makes it difficult for bots to scrape our site in large
                    numbers.</li>
                    <li>This helps protect the site from misuse and keeps it running smoothly for everyone.</li>
                    <li>By verifying your identity, you're helping to keep our site safe and secure for all users.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Please note that some browser extension, like JShelter, may interfere with this process. If you're using such an extension, please
                temporarily disable it for this site.</p>
                <p>Thanks for your patience!</p>
